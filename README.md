# Compliance schemas

This repository contains YAML schemas that can be used when implementing compliance as code and/or continuous compliance.
* standardschema.yaml can be used to enforce the same format for all schema files. Useful when complying to multiple standards/regulations.
* ETSI_EN_303645.yaml contains all the provisions in ETSI EN 303 645.
* CRA.yaml CURRENTLY ONLY CONTAINS Annex I requirements from the EU Cyber Resilience Act.

For a description on what this is useful for, see the [article on compliance as code and continuous compliance](https://github.com/baldvin137/ComplianceSchemas/wiki/Continuous-compliance-and-compliance-as-code) on the repository wiki.

I have cleared my use of [ETSI EN 303 645](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/303600_303699/303645/02.01.01_60/en_303645v020101p.pdf) with the ETSI legal team. The use of  
[EU Cyber Resilience Act](https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/PE-100-2023-INIT/en/pdf) is based on Decision 2011/833/EU.*
