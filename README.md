# complianceschemas

This repository contains YAML schemas that can be used when implementing compliance as code and/or continuous compliance. Currently there is only a schema for ETSI EN 303 645, but I'm hoping to add the EU Cyber Resilience Act soon. 

NOTE: These schemas are provided as-is and may contain errors that deviate from the official documentation of the standards or regulations they refer to. Although I provide these files under a CC license, the original work on which they are based may have a different license. I have cleared my use of [ETSI EN 303 645](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/303600_303699/303645/02.01.01_60/en_303645v020101p.pdf) with ETSI legal team. I am assuming fair use of EU law for the 
[EU Cyber Resilience Act](https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/PE-100-2023-INIT/en/pdf).
